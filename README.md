# Simple Todo List
This is a simple todo list application built with rails and react. It uses some react components while other parts of the application are traditional rails.

Some basic features are:
- Users are identified by email
- Users login by authenticating with their email address and password
- Users may create as many separate lists as they want
- Lists must have a name/title
- Lists may have a description but it is optional
- Lists can be created without adding items (e.g. a user can create an empty list to use later)
- Lists can contain many items (with no limit)
- List items should have a title, a state (not started, in progress, complete), and an optional note/description

I am using haml for layouts, coffee for my javascript and scss for stylesheets.
